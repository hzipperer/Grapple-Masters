# Grapple-Masters

Are you a Grapple Master? Prove it by tackling this version of the classic game of "The Floor is Lava".

## Objective
In each level you must make it to the end (The red platform) without touching the lava. If at any point you do touch the lava you will
get sent back to the start.

Each level will start off with a 3 second countdown to let you know when your time will start.

Try to beat each level as fast as you can. Your best times will be saved and displayed on the level select screen.

If you can beat a level's Master Time, your best time will gild. This signifies that you are truly a Grapple Master.
